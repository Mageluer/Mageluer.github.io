Below are Mongolian folksongs in the book [《蒙古民歌集》](https://mulliken.github.io/book/%E9%B2%81%E8%89%BA_%E8%92%99%E5%8F%A4%E6%B0%91%E6%AD%8C%E9%9B%86.pdf). The book has 165 folksongs and the songs were collected in 1948, in Zuu Uda League (昭乌达盟) and Jusotu League (卓索图盟/召斯图盟) (two cities in eastern Inner Mongolia) where Horqin Mongols, Baarin Mongols, and Tumed Mongols live. Most of the editors of the book were from 鲁迅艺术学院. The list below is under construction.
