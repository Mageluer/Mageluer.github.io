## Check the version
Python runs on many operating systems such as MS-Windows, Mac OS, Mac OS X, Linux, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, Solaris, AIX, and many varieties of free UNIX like systems. The latest version of CentOS, Fedora, RHEL and Ubuntu come with **Python 2.7** out of the box. 

To see which version of Python you have install, open a command terminal and run:

{% highlight bash %}
$ python --version
{% endhighlight %}

Sample outputs:

{% highlight bash %}
Python 2.7.11
{% endhighlight %}

Or type:

{% highlight bash %}
$ python
{% endhighlight %}

Sample outputs:

{% highlight bash %}
Python 2.7.11 (default, Aug  9 2016, 15:45:42) 
[GCC 5.3.1 20160406 (Red Hat 5.3.1-6)] on linux2
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> 
{% endhighlight %}

That is the version of python you have got and you can start building Python applications .

## Use package manager
The easiest way to install the Python is to use package manger such as apt-get, yum, and so on.

### Debian / Ubuntu Linux user
Use the following command to search for available versions of Python2.x under Debian and Ubuntu Linux:

{% highlight bash %}
$ apt-cache search python | egrep "^python2.[0-9] " --color
{% endhighlight %}

Type the following command to install python version 2.x:

{% highlight bash %}
$ sudo apt-get install python2.6
{% endhighlight %}

Type the following command to install python version 3.x:

{% highlight bash %}
$ sudo apt-get install python3.1
{% endhighlight %}

Sample outputs:

{% highlight bash %}

{% endhighlight %}

Read the README file to figure out how to install, or do the following with no guarantees:

{% highlight bash %}
$ ./configure  
$ make  
$ sudo make install  
{% endhighlight %}

For Python 3.5 use the following download address:  <http://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.5.1/Python-3.5.1.tgz>

## Others

### Setuptools & Pip
The two most crucial third-party Python packages are [setuptools](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools) and [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/).

Python 2.7.9 and later (on the python2 series), and Python 3.4 and later include pip by default.

To see if pip is installed, open a command prompt and run:

{% highlight bash %}
$ command -v pip
{% endhighlight %}

To install pip, follow [the official pip installation guide](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing/) - this will automatically install the latest version of setuptools.

### Environment variable
Also add the path of new python in 'PATH' environment variable. 

Type the following command if new python is in `/root/python-2.7.4`:

{% highlight bash %}
$ export PATH = "$PATH":/root/python-2.7.4
{% endhighlight %}
